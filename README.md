This website was designed for the first portfolio Project in my code institute course. I wanted to focus on builing a simple website, which would be easy to navigate, and as it is my first deployed website, easy to build and deploy. I decided to focus on a coffee history website as I recently attended a coffee tasting in a speciality coffee shop.

The website can be directly reached through the following link: <a href="https://niall71.github.io/Project-1-with-template/" target="_blank"> Speciality Coffee </a>

## Features of the site

This website is fairly sparse and was purposfully designed so that I could quickly understand changes that I implemented.

The most prominant feature of this site is the navigation menu in the header.
