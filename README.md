This website was designed for the first portfolio Project in my code institute course. I wanted to focus on builing a simple website, which would be easy to navigate, and as it is my first deployed website, easy to build and deploy. I decided to focus on a coffee history website as I recently attended a coffee tasting in a speciality coffee shop.

The website can be directly reached through the following link: <a href="https://niall71.github.io/Project-1-with-template/" target="_blank"> Speciality Coffee </a>


## Features of the Site

This website is fairly sparse and was purposfully designed so that I could quickly understand changes that I implemented.

### Navigation Menu

The most prominant feature of this site is the navigation menu in the header.

This navigation menu quickly guides the user to the relevant section. Each option is fully clickable and the contrast between the lettering and background should work for visually impaired users.

### Gallery

There is a simple and easy to view image gallery. It simply displays images of coffee in its various stages, from berry to brewed.

Each image is clearly labeled and there is alt text descriptors for site users who are using screen reaaders. The images are spaced apart from each other and the site was designed that they keep their position no matter the size of screen that is being used. 

### Clickable Link

In the Contact Us section there is a clickable link which opens facebook in a new tab. The facebook icon is properly styled using the facebook template from font awesome. Additionally this button is accessible to those using screen readers as there is alt text and an explanation that this button opens in a new tab.

### Copyright in footer

A copyright section with the correct symbol is clearly and properly displayed at the bottom of the screen.


## Validation

The site has been successfully validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service and W3C HTML Validation Service.

No issues were shown with either serivce and while deploying through github no bugs are other deployment issues were noted.

## Site Development

I developed this site using Visual Studio Code. I heavily relied upon the Introduction to HTML and Introduction to CSS courses on Code Institute, and the examples which I worked through on the LMS. This site was coded on my desktop version of VSC and copied directly to the github files which I created.

I composed the text in the history section of the site on my computers text editor. The historical information I used was primarily from a class on coffee tasting which I recently attended at Caffenation Amsterdam.

Additionally I used code directly from font awesome to integrate the free to use font awesome facebook logo

On github I directly used the Code Institute Git Template. This allowed me to deploy a live site through github. 

All images on the site are copyright free and are hosted on pexel. These images are directly linked live to pexel.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the Florian and Ahmed at Caffenation Amsterdam for the coffee theme inspiration. I would also like to thank Amy my cohort coordinator for checking in.
