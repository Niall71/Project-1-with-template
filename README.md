This website was designed for the first portfolio Project in my code institute course. I wanted to focus on builing a simple website, which would be easy to navigate, and as it is my first deployed website, easy to build and deploy. I decided to focus on a coffee history website as I recently attended a coffee tasting in a speciality coffee shop.

The website can be directly reached through the following link: <a href="https://niall71.github.io/Project-1-with-template/" target="_blank"> Speciality Coffee </a>

## Features of the Site

This website is fairly sparse and was purposfully designed so that I could quickly understand changes that I implemented.

### Navigation Menu

The most prominant feature of this site is the navigation menu in the header.

This navigation menu quickly guides the user to the relevant section. Each option is fully clickable and the contrast between the lettering and background should work for visually impaired users.

### Gallery

There is a simple and easy to view image gallery. It simply displays images of coffee in its various stages, from berry to brewed.

Each image is clearly labeled and there is alt text descriptors for site users who are using screen reaaders. The images are spaced apart from each other and the site was designed that they keep their position no matter the size of screen that is being used.
