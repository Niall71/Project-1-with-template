  <article id="history">
    <h2>From Early Coffee to Speciality Coffee</h2>
    <p>Coffee is now one of the most popular drinks in the world. Legend has it that the effects of the coffee plant were first discovered by an Ethiopian goat herder called Kaldi. Kaldi had noticed that his goats became energetic after eating the berries from a specific tree, and so tested the berries on himself. Other plausible origins for the drink stem from Yemen. Coffee quickly came to have a place in Sufi rituals allowing them to stay awake throughout the night.</p>
    <p>Coffee had become a popular drink in the Islamic world by the 16th century, with coffeehouses serving as important social hubs. By the 17th century coffee has spread to Europe, with the first European coffeehouse opening in Vienna in 1645. From Vienna the drink spread throughout the continent. Coffeehouses quickly became places of socialisation and discussion, and served as the birthplace of important cultural and intellectual developments. Coffee quickly became an important commodity, to keep up with the rising demand for this drink, coffee plantations were established throughout the world.</p>
    <p>Speciality coffee, sometimes also known as third wave coffee, refers to coffee that is produced and prepared to a high quality, with a focus on flavour and aroma. The term was first used in the 1970â€™s to describe beans of the best flavour from specific climates. Typically specialty coffee emphasises traceability and sustainability. Speciality coffee is a recent phenomenon and represents a shift away from mass produced coffee, towards coffee production which emphasises more the roasting, brewing, and flavours of the coffee.</p>
    <p>Nowadays speciality coffee also must meet certain standards as set out by the Speciality Coffee Association, this includes scoring over 80 points on a score sheet measuring the defects of beans. Additionally it must be from the Arabica varietal. Over recent years the speciality coffee industry has grown enormously.</p>
